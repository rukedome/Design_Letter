          Pretty much everyone hits a low point 
          sometime throughout their life. Hopelessness 
          sets in, waves of sadness can crash in on us 
          and there are times when we have no idea who 
          or what to turn to. Sue Goodrich hit this point 
          in her life after the sudden death of her mother. 
          Consumed by grief, Goodrich would often visit 
          the Glenmere Public Beach Access in Kill Devil 
          Hills, where a gazebo sits atop a rising set of 
          stairs to overlook the ocean. As she would cry 
          in the gazebo, Goodrich said she felt her mom 
          reaching out and saying: “Sue, if you feel sad, 
          help somebody else out.”
          Remembering an idea she had way back 
          when, Goodrich decided to slowly start 
          making her thoughts into a reality. Goodrich 
          said she would run into Roy Edlund, the OBX 
          Beach Bum photographer, at Starbucks every 
          so often. Goodrich would talk with Edlund 
          about her visits to Glenmere and eventually 
          Edlund gave her a beautiful print of the beach 
          access. “Something was missing,” Goodrich 
          started, “the Little Red Mailbox.”

          After approaching the Town of Kill Devil Hills 
          with her idea for installing a mailbox of hope, 
          Goodrich said the town embraced the 
          concept. In July of 2014, a small bench was 
          built in the gazebo along with a bright red 
          mailbox, containing a little notebook. "I had 
          no idea how this would take off," Goodrich 
          told The Coastland Times. People from all 
          across the country would come and see the 
          mailbox. They would write inspiring quotes, 
          letters of loss and leave trinkets in the mailbox 
          for Goodrich to find and read weekly. The 
          Town of Kill Devil Hills started posting 
          "Mailbox Monday" updates on their Facebook 
          page, with photos of the hopeful notes and 
          positive messages. Goodrich said the town is even 
          creating a digital archive of all the notes 
          left in the mailbox at Glenmere.

          This sentiment of hope spread soon after Goodrich’s first 
          mailbox was installed. Now there are 18 Little Red Mailboxes 
          with locations in North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania and 
          New Jersey.  Goodrich mentioned that the one mailbox, 
          located in Douglassville, Pa., was started after a mother and 
          her daughter went to visit Glenmere. “She was trying to help 
          her daughter heal from her best friend that took her own life,” 
          Goodrich explained.  The message of the mailbox was so 
          powerful that the mother decided to bring it back with her to 
          their own community, where others were suffering and could 
          use some hope. “The truth is that everybody needs hope,” 
          Goodrich said. To help spread that message of hope to people 
          who cannot access the mailboxes daily, Goodrich also posts 
          pictures of the letters, notes, cards and postcards that people 
          leave to her Facebook and Instagram pages. Others have 
          done the same, including Adrienne Palma, a resident of 
          Manteo. Palma had a mailbox installed at the north end of 
          Manteo. She also checks the mail there on Mondays and will 
          share the thoughts found within through another Facebook 
          page. The purpose of the Little Red Mailbox is to share 
          thoughts or messages to help brighten someone’s day; 
          someone who may be going through a tough time or needs 
          some inspiration.  It stands as a striking symbol of hope, 
          reminding us all that everyone goes through hardships, but the 
          world will always be filled with people to help get us through.
